# Data Visualization Improvements

## Current State Analysis

The mood tracking app currently uses:
- **Chart.js** (v4.4.6) for the main MoodGraph component
- **Recharts** (v2.12.2) installed but underutilized
- Simple line chart showing mood values (-4 to 4) over time
- Basic time range filtering (7 days, 30 days, 1 year)
- Purple color scheme with minimal styling

## Improvement Opportunities

### 1. Enhanced Tooltips and Interactivity
- **Rich tooltips**: Show all tracked data (sleep, exercise, medication, notes) when hovering
- **Click-to-view**: Allow clicking data points to view/edit full entry details
- **Zoom and pan**: Add brush selection for exploring specific date ranges
- **Keyboard navigation**: Make charts accessible with arrow keys

### 2. Multi-Metric Visualization
- **Layered metrics**: Add toggleable layers for sleep hours, exercise, medication adherence
- **Synchronized charts**: Multiple charts that zoom/pan together
- **Correlation views**: Sleep vs mood scatter plots, exercise impact analysis
- **Wellness score**: Combined metric showing overall daily wellness

### 3. Visual Indicators and Markers
- **Mixed state markers**: Different point style/color for mixed episodes
- **Activity badges**: Icons for therapy, support group, medication taken
- **Streak indicators**: Highlight consecutive good mood days
- **Data completeness**: Show which days have full vs partial data

### 4. Better Data Aggregation
- **Smart time periods**: Weekly averages for monthly view, monthly for yearly
- **Statistical overlays**: Moving averages, standard deviation bands, trend lines
- **Mood distribution**: Show time spent in each mood range
- **Pattern detection**: Identify weekly/monthly cycles

### 5. Theme and Accessibility
- **Dark mode support**: Adaptive chart colors with proper contrast
- **Color blind modes**: Alternative color schemes
- **ARIA labels**: Screen reader support for all chart elements
- **High contrast**: Option for better visibility

### 6. Alternative Visualizations
- **Mood calendar heatmap**: GitHub-style contribution graph for mood
- **Radar charts**: Daily wellness metrics in circular format
- **Stacked bar charts**: Show mood distribution by week/month
- **Area charts**: Mood ranges with confidence intervals
- **Sparklines**: Mini charts in summary cards

### 7. Unused Data Field Visualizations
Currently tracked but not visualized:
- **Sleep quality**: Interrupted vs uninterrupted sleep patterns
- **Physical symptoms**: Track and correlate with mood
- **Substance use**: Show impact on mood patterns
- **Meal tracking**: Nutrition consistency indicators
- **Therapy attendance**: Session frequency and mood impact
- **Medication details**: Compliance tracking and effectiveness

### 8. Export and Sharing Enhancements
- **PDF reports**: Weekly/monthly mood reports with charts
- **Image export**: Save charts as PNG/SVG
- **Data portability**: JSON export with full history
- **Share summaries**: Generate shareable weekly insights
- **Print-friendly**: Optimized layouts for printing

### 9. Performance Optimizations
- **Virtualization**: Only render visible data points
- **Progressive loading**: Load data in chunks for large datasets
- **Caching**: Store calculated values (averages, trends)
- **Web Workers**: Offload heavy calculations

### 10. Integration with Existing Features
- **Leaderboard integration**: Show user's position on mood graph
- **Motivational quotes**: Correlate quotes with mood trends
- **Confetti triggers**: Celebrate improvement milestones
- **Personalized insights**: Use welcome name for custom messages
